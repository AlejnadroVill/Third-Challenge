# Payroll Hound 9000
Stay on top of your payroll: track every penny that flows through your organization.

## Description
Track like a bloodhound! This web app enables you to analyze your payroll and the number of employees. Through the console, you'll gain insights into the quality of your organization's salaries. Moreover, we've incorporated a lottery feature to incentivize your employees.

Add your organization's employees limitlessly and in separate rows.

Once you've added employees, you'll receive payroll data in the console. You'll also discover the lucky employee who won the monthly award.
