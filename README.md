# Payroll Hound 9000
Stay on top of your payroll: track every penny that flows through your organization.

## Description
This challenge is to test if I can pull, commit and push an existing code from a marketing agency website – along with the site assets, such as images – to a GitHub repository, so that I finally demonstrate that I can deploy a website.
It was also a first taste of how to clean-up a code, to facilitate further improvements.

## Installation
You’ll just have to access the website [here](https://github.com/AlejnadroVill/Third-Challenge), no installation required.

## Usage
To fully experience Payroll Hound, you'll need to open your console in DevTools. Simply press cmd + alt + j and explore our features.

Add new employees by clicking on Add Employees and following the prompts. If you input an invalid value, don't fret; your progress will be saved. You'll have the option to add multiple employees simultaneously.

Once you've added employees, you'll receive payroll data in the console. You'll also discover the lucky employee who won the monthly award.

This is how it should look like:
